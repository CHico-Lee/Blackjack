# Blackjack
Data Structures and Algorithms Final Project (Fall 2015)

## Description

A Command-line program simulates the gambling card game "Blackjack".
Players will be able to set bet, hit, stand, double down and surrender. 
The dealer must hit on 16 and stand on 17.
Most of the BlackJack general rule will also apply to this program.
Player records are stored by name. Tokens will be retrieved from the last game.


## Requirements

Cards will be stored by the linked lists with data structure queue. 
Cards also simulate both strip and riffle (by Hand) shuffling. 
In order to shuffle cards randomly, create a list of random numbers, then sort the number list with Merge sort.
When the numbers are swapping in the list, cards will also swap.
Use template class in the shoe (card holder). Allows storing different type of cards. 
Store players records in vector, reads and writes into a text file.


## Unfinished Work

Split feature for cards with the same rank. Card cut in the shoe, indicate time to shuffling

## Tools used
